Feature: Add link to thread
  As a curator
  I want to add a link to my thread
  So that I can share it with other users

  Background:
    Given I am logged in through Twitter as the following user:
      | name     | Cojiro Sasaki |
      | uid      | 12345         |
      | nickname | csasaki       |
    And my locale is "en"
    And the following thread exists:
      | user    | csasaki                                |
      | title   | Capoeira in Japan and around the world |
      | summary | The martial art of capoeira originated in Brazil, but is now popular all around the world. There is a particularly vibrant community in Japan. |
    And the thread has the following links:
      | user    | source_locale | title                 | summary | url                         |
      | csasaki | en            | Best Capoeira Brazil  |         | http://youtu.be/6H0D8VaIli0 |
    And I am on the thread "Capoeira in Japan and around the world"
