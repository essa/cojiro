Feature: Add link to thread
  As a curator
  I want to add a link to my thread
  So that I can share it with other users

  Background:
    Given I am logged in through Twitter as the following user:
      | name     | Cojiro Sasaki |
      | uid      | 12345         |
      | nickname | csasaki       |
    And my locale is "en"
    And the following thread exists:
      | user    | csasaki                                |
      | title   | Capoeira in Japan and around the world |
      | summary | The martial art of capoeira originated in Brazil, but is now popular all around the world. There is a particularly vibrant community in Japan. |
    And the thread has the following links:
      | user    | source_locale | title                 | summary | url                         |
      | csasaki | en            | Best Capoeira Brazil  |         | http://youtu.be/6H0D8VaIli0 |
    And I am on the thread "Capoeira in Japan and around the world"
    And I have added the link "http://youtu.be/Z8xxgFpK-NM"

  @vcr
  Scenario: Add link with no source locale
    When I click on "Add to this thread"
    Then the "This link is in" field should have a red box around it
    Then the "This link is in" field should have an error message "can't be blank"

  @vcr
  Scenario: Add link with no changes
    When I select "English" from the drop-down list
    And I click on "Add to this thread"
    And I wait for the AJAX call to finish
    Then I should see a link with url "http://youtu.be/Z8xxgFpK-NM" in the thread
    And the link should have the title "The best capoeira video ever"
    #And the link should have the summary "Capoeiristas Isaak and Bicudinho from the group Senzala de Santos. I don't own this video, I found it at www.d1autremonde.com"
    And I should see a link with url "http://youtu.be/6H0D8VaIli0" in the thread
    And the link should have the title "Best Capoeira Brazil"
    And I should see that the thread has 2 links
