Feature: Create new thread
  As a curator
  I want to create a new thread
  So that I can group and share my sources on a topic and discuss them with others

  Background:

      | name  |
      | alice |

  Scenario: User successfully creates a new thread

    When I create the following thread:
      | title   | Co-working spaces in Tokyo |
      | summary | I want to write an an article about the increased popularity of co-working spaces. |
    Then I should see the new thread "Co-working spaces in Tokyo"
    And I should see a success message
